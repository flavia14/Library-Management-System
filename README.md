# Library Management System

## Project Overview

In this project, my goal was to design and build a Library Management System from scratch. The system is designed to handle the primary housekeeping functions of a library, including managing asset collections and member relationships. This application keeps track of books and their checkouts, as well as membersâ€™ subscriptions and profiles.

## Features

- **Class Design**: Created and implemented the class structure for the entire system.
- **Design Patterns**: Utilized various design patterns, such as the Observer Pattern and Adapter Pattern, especially for the notification system.
- **Custom Migration System**: Developed a proprietary system to manage database migrations.
- **Docker Configuration**: Set up a custom Docker environment for the application.
- **Pipeline Configuration**: Configured the CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

## Libraries and Tools Used

### Core Libraries
- **PHP 8.3**: Leveraged the latest features and performance improvements.
- **PDO Extension**: Used for database interactions.
- **vlucas/phpdotenv**: Managed environment variables.
- **MySQLi Extension**: Used for MySQL database interactions.
- **Illuminate/Database**: Eloquent ORM for database management.
- **bramus/router**: Simple routing for handling HTTP requests.
- **php-di/php-di**: Dependency Injection container.

### Development Tools
- **phpstan/phpstan**: Static analysis tool to improve code quality.
- **phpstan/phpstan-strict-rules**: Additional strict rules for PHPStan.
- **phpunit/phpunit**: Testing framework to ensure code reliability.
- **slevomat/coding-standard**: Coding standards for PHP_CodeSniffer.

## Conclusion

This Library Management System project showcases the use of modern PHP practices, design patterns, and robust library integrations to create a functional and scalable application. By building everything from scratch, I gained a deeper understanding of the inner workings of such systems and improved my skills in software design and development.
